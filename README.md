_Backend & Fullstack Development ‚Ä¢ Fintech & SaaS ‚Ä¢ API Integrations ‚Ä¢ Performance Optimization ‚Ä¢ CI/CD & DevOps ‚Ä¢ Technical Documentation_

## Where do I come from?

In December 2022 I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering with good marks. I started my professional IT career in January 2023, with a backend developer position in fintech.

## What are my intentions?

I intend to build the greatest solutions with best, ethical, sustainable, and agile practices to accelerate business growth, meet customers' needs, and do more good for the world.

## What have I done?

I have:
- reduced a highly used database call's latency ~75 % from 13 seconds to 1,6 seconds by completely rewriting an API service used by our customer support tool. Rewrite included chopping down a single monolithic query into multiple conditionally run queries, as well as adding indexing, moving methods into their own services for maintainability, and refactoring duplicate code into commonly used methods
- created and managed multiple new API integrations to different partners (lenders, insurance companies, credit registers), boosting direct money flow
- launched a new product brokering credit cards to consumers
- done most production deployments in my company since hiring (353 and counting), using CircleCI pipelines with Docker + Kubernetes, to AWS
- suggested now widely used company practices (such as an it support slack channel)
- improved documentation across several key areas of software development (comments in code, Readme files, GitBook articles, internal and external API documentation with Redocly and OpenAPI)


Below are some personal projects:
