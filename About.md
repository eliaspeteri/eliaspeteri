## ðŸ¥‡ Core Philosophy & Skill Summary

- I focus on **delivering** backend services that are wellâ€‘tested, wellâ€‘documented, and easy for others to extend.
- I build **platforms, not scripts** â€” always considering system level, scalability, and user safety  
- I prefer hands-on documentation and CI/CD over promises ("Yes, test is green and deploy is automated")
